# Emoji Prediction using Deep Learning
Emojis are a wonderful method to express oneself.

This deep learning project automatically predicts emojis based on a given phrase.

<b>About Emoji Prediction Project:</b><br>
In this machine learning project, we predict the emoji from the given text. This means we build a text classifier that returns an emoji that suits the given text.
Our systems should be aware of the relevant emoji to use at the proper moment.

<p><b>Emoji Prediciton Dataset:</b><br>
The dataset consists of 2 parts, each is used for training and testing the deep learning model.The training dataset contains 4 columns, one column being the text and the other contains IDs representing the emojis. Here in our dataset the same sentence can have more than 1 emoji as a result.</p>
